# TDC-600-Source-Code
Project to reproduce the source code of the Talent TDC-600 Disk Interface

The goal of this project is to recreate a compatible source code for the Talent TDC-600 Disk Interface for the MSX Family of computers.  So that it may be used as a basis for other projects utilizing MSX-DOS 1 binaries for Floppy Drives or Floppy Emulators.

Portions of this project can be considered a Fork of: https://sourceforge.net/projects/msxsyssrc/

This work was used as a baseline since it is already somewhat documented, and provides a great deal of insight to the way the ROM functions.  And comparison against the original ROM and it's Disassembled code is easy.

The main focus of this project will be, at this time, the driver portion of the ROM.  As this is the portion need to relocate the disk controller into other areas of memory or the IO space.
