TDC-600 Notes

MSX-DOS Version
---------------
The BIO ROM Appears to be based on version disk850902.mac

	This is suggested by what I suspect is a signature at memory
	location 7E96H:
 
		DEFB "TALENT.1",00H
		DEFB 00H,02H,02H,01H,00H,02H,70H,00H,D0H,02H,FDH,02H,00H,09H,00H,02H,00H,00H,00H
	
	If we look at the last 8 bytes of what I suspect is a signature we see:
		02h 00h 09h 00h 02h 00h 00h 00h
   
	This could be read as: Version 02, Date 0902, 000
 
	If we look to the disk850902.mac file, we see the note:
		
		; DOS 1.02 kernel (most common used)
		; version number is not offical, it is created by me
		; Assume this is version Sep  2, 1985 (fixed disk damage and template problem)
		
	Though, it is noted it is an unofficial version, the information does match up.
	And is consistent with information at: https://www.msx.org/wiki/The_History_of_MSX-DOS
	This information suggests there was an update to COMMAND.COM on Sept 2, 1985.  Which leads
	me to believe this was in fact an updated BIOS for the MSX-DOS version. However, the current
	MSXDOS.SYS version number would have been 1.03.  Though it is plausible that an older version
	of the MSX Kernel would have been used, or was still current at that time.  Or that v1.02 of
	the BIOS was released at that time.  Again, mostly speculation at this point.
